# ShopEnd


MERN stack based ecommerce e-kart [ShopEnd](https://shopenddark.herokuapp.com/) 



Deployed at Heroku URL-> https://shopenddark.herokuapp.com/



For locally initiating this project just first git clone then in root run `npm install` for server dependencies then `cd frontend` then  
again run `npm install` for frontend-react dependencies . So, we are done with all the installing dependencies. Feel free to add any other packages that you like. 



Now `cd ..` back to root now to run server locally run `npm run server`  or to run frontend only locally run `npm run client` ,
or to run both frontend and backend as well in one go use `npm run dev`



Hurray you did it now every thing is setup you can try editing or just watching the project .
In this project I integrated Paypal Checkout payment method and in future I might as well add Stripe Pyment Checkout Method.  




Just for developers those who want to contribute just make a new branch after cloning this repo then give a pull request if you added a feature and name the branch as YOURNAME/BRANCH.
